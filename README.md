This project uses a cloud database which is mongodb atlas. In the database for log records, your ip adress and computer name will be saved. For enable you to manage your accounts this application also saves your username and your password-encrypted with SHA256-. 

For the instructor who is reading this, 
You can use this account instead of creating a new one: username = ITUADMIN
                                                        password = ITUITUADMINADMIN1773
               
In the submission there is a file **accinfos** in the folder **important** which includes all information about database access. To manage the database, a completely new gmail account and mongodb account are created. I have shared the passwords information, birthday information, gender information etc..
