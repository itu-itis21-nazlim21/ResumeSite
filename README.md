For the instructor who is reading this, 
You can use this account instead of creating a new one: username = ITUADMIN
                                                        password = ITUITUADMINADMIN1773
               
In the submission there is a file **accinfos** in the folder **important** which includes all information about database access. To manage the database, a completely new gmail account and mongodb account are created. I have shared the passwords information, birthday information, gender information etc..
