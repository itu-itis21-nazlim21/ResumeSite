            <p>I was born in 2001 in Yozgat. After living there for a 
                short time, I lived in different provinces 
                of Turkey such as Zonguldak, Kutahya and Sakarya. 
                I started my university life with Galatasaray University 
                Computer Engineering. After studying there for a year and 
                successfully completing the French preparatory class, I transferred 
                to the Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering department of Istanbul 
                Technical University. I am currently continuing my studies at ITU. 
                I love to deal with computers and technology and I am in love with mathematics.
                I can speak intermediate English and moderate French.
